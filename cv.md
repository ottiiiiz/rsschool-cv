About Me:
The main goal why I want to learn JS and become a programmer is a high salary and the ability to work remotely so that I can travel more around the world and not be tied to a number.
I already have some programming experience.
I taught myself the basic knowledge of HTML and CSS, as well as a little bit of JS.
I planned to buy courses, but decided that it was better not to spend money on it, because all the information can be found on the Internet.
My preferences are the desire for development, perseverance and independence.

Skills: basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, JS.

Code example:

        const randomNumber = Math.random();
        let computerMove = '';

        if (randomNumber >= 0 && randomNumber < 1 / 3) {
          computerMove = 'stone';
        } else if (randomNumber >= 1/3 && randomNumber < 2/3) {
          computerMove = 'paper';
        } else if (randomNumber >= 2 / 3 && randomNumber < 1) {
          computerMove = 'scissors';
        }

Education: Incomplete higher education

English level: A2 (elementary)
